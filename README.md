From the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) website:
>Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets
>and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as
>interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest,
>or to challenge each other.

## 2023
This is my first year solving puzzles each day they are posted.

Once upon a time, I was a [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) developer. It's been about
five years since I've worked in Ruby, so I thought it would be a fun refresher.

See [my solutions](2023) to each day's puzzle.

## 2022
Working backwards in time, starting with the puzzles from last year.

I always wanted to like [Python](https://www.python.org/), but have never really been able
to. I'm not a fan of forced indenting. Also, I really just feel like Python is limited in
its expressiveness. Limiting...possibly even constricting, haha.

See [my solutions](2022) to each day's puzzle.

## 2021
Another year backwards, and this time I'm going to work in [C++](https://cplusplus.com/). In a
previous life, I built large, complex, highly performant and highly parallel applications in C++.
It isn't a language well-suited to quick daily puzzles. But...we'll see how it goes.

See [my solutions](2021) to each day's puzzle.

## 2020
For this year, I'm going to solve everything in [Perl](https://perl.org). It's been quite a
while since I've used Perl for anything more than a one-liner (college, really). So, this
should be an interesting trip down memory lane. Ha ha, get it? "Memory" lane, because these
puzzles tend to require a lot of memory to brute-force.

See [my solutions](2020) to each puzzle.

## 2019
Now it will be [Java](https://www.java.com/en/)'s turn. I once taught a class in Java. I have
never liked Java and I don't find it either fun or practical. The syntax is awful and overly
complex, and the runtime is heavy and unpredictable.

See [my solutions](2019) in Java.

## 2018
I am beginning with [C# .NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/languages/csharp) even though
I'm not done with 2019 yet. I've dabbled in .NET here and there over the years, but have yet to
do much beyond minor modifications to existing code.

See [my solutions](2018) in .NET Core.

## 2017
Might as well try these in [Node](https://nodejs.org/) also. I have a feeling this will be a bit
awkward. As good at Node is at something, processing lines of input doesn't seem like one of
them.

See [my solutions](2017) in Node.
