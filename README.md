From the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) website:

>and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as
>interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest,
>or to challenge each other.

## 2023
This is my first year solving puzzles each day they are posted.

Once upon a time, I was a [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) developer. It's been about
five years since I've worked in Ruby, so I thought it would be a fun refresher.

See [my solutions](2023) to each day's puzzle.
