From the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) website:
>Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets
>and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as
>interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest,
>or to challenge each other.

## 2023
This is my first year solving puzzles each day they are posted.

Once upon a time, I was a [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) developer. It's been about
five years since I've worked in Ruby, so I thought it would be a fun refresher.

See [my solutions](2023) to each day's puzzle.

## 2022
Working backwards in time, starting with the puzzles from last year.

I always wanted to like [Python](https://www.python.org/), but have never really been able
to. I'm not a fan of forced indenting. Also, I really just feel like Python is limited in
its expressiveness. Limiting...possibly even constricting, haha.

## 2021
Another year backwards, and this time I'm going to work in [C++](https://cplusplus.com/). In a
previous life, I built large, complex, highly performant and highly parallel applications in C++.
It isn't a language well-suited to quick daily puzzles. But...we'll see how it goes.

## 2020
For this year, I'm going to solve everything in [Perl](https://perl.org). It's been quite a
while since I've used Perl for anything more than a one-liner (college, really). So, this
should be an interesting trip down memory lane. Ha ha, get it? "Memory" lane, because these
puzzles tend to require a lot of memory to brute-force.
