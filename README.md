## 2023
This is my first year solving puzzles each day they are posted.

Once upon a time, I was a [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) developer. It's been about
five years since I've worked in Ruby, so I thought it would be a fun refresher.

See [my solutions](2023) to each day's puzzle.

## 2022
Working backwards in time, starting with the puzzles from last year.

I always wanted to like [Python](https://www.python.org/), but have never really been able
to. I'm not a fan of forced indenting. Also, I really just feel like Python is limited in
its expressiveness. Limiting...possibly even constricting, haha.
