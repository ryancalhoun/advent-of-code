# Day 2: Rock Paper Scissors

[Full info here](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/2)

This puzzle ended up being almost exclusively dictionary lookups. The codes,
the scoring, the what-beats-what, are all pre-defined as dictionaries.

For part 2, the behavior for how to win, lose, or draw against a given value
are defined in a dictionary.

And as a bonus, even though I had my dictionary for what-beats-what (given
the loser, look up the winner), it actually works in the other direction by
performing the lookup twice.
