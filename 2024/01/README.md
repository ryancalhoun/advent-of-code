# Day 1: Historian Hysteria

This was a decent into to Go. Basic IO, arrays and maps.

Part 1 required sorting and differencing parallel arrays. Interesting that
Go has no built-in abs function.

Part 2, a first pass to count all values in list two using a map. Then a
second pass to look those counts up using the values in list one.
