# Day 3: Squares With Three Sides

[Full info here](https://adventofcode.com/2016/day/3)

Octave has plenty of good matrix- and vector-friendly operations,
but lots of arithmetic that I tend to take for granted doesn't work when
indexes start at 1.

I messed with array slices until I got the row and column groupings that
I needed, but I'm not sure this is the best way to take every 3 elements
from a list.
