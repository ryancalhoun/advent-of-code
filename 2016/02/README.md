# Day 2: Bathroom Security

[Full info here](https://adventofcode.com/2016/day/2)

I created the button layouts for parts 1 and 2 as 2-d arrays. The
current position is a 2-element array, and the 4 possible directions
are each 2-element arrays. For each character in the input, I look
up the direction and update the position.

Still getting the hang of Octave's data types and operators.
