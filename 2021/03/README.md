# Day 3: Binary Diagnostic

[Full info here](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/3)

The basic steps of this puzzle were pretty simple, just some counting
with bitmasks.

The main challenge was organizing the code in a reasonable way in C++.
I always thought the syntax for function pointers was fun, but using it
now does make me miss the simplicity of lambdas and blocks.

Well, last time I worked in C++, there were no lambdas. Apparently now
there are.

I will need to make an effort to try out some of these "new to me"
features in coming puzzles.
