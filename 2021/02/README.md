# Day 2: Dive!

This puzzle was pretty straightforward, with most of the required solution
steps spelled out literally in the description.

For part 1, manipulate the depth directly. For part 2, the depth is only updated
when moving forward.

I was expecting a twist like having the sub surface, and preventing the depth
from becoming negative. But, that ended up not being an issue.
