# Day 12: JSAbacusFramework.io

[Full info here](https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/12)

Languages:
* Bash (paste/bc)
* Jq

This is, I think, the least amount of code I've written for any day's puzzle.
Of cource, Jq was literally made to query and manipulate Json data, so it's the
perfect pre-made solution for this one.
