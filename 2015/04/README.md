# Day 4: The Ideal Stocking Stuffer

[Full info here](https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/4)

Languages:
* Python
* PostgreSQL

I used the PostgreSQL engine to generate and match the MD5 of the sequence.

I used Python to paginate the SQL query until the first result. Without pagination,
I needed a very large sequence in SQL and this ends up being slow.

This one is weird and that's why I like it.
