# Day 14: Reindeer Olympics

[Full info here](https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/14)

Languages:
* C
* Ruby

I created a Reindeer class in Ruby, which can calculate distance and track
points for a single reindeer.

I used Ruby's C-API to load and interact with Ruby objects directly, create
instances and compare distances.
