# Day 9: Sensor Boost

[Full info here](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/9)

I made the following IntCode changes:

* The values are all long instead of int
* The code is a Map instead of an array
* The new relative mode is added

Everything just worked once those changes were done. The puzzle didn't
require any additional app logic.
