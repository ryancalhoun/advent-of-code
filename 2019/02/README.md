# Day 2: 1202 Program Alarm

[Full info here](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/2)

This puzzle didn't have a clear sample to follow, so I had to kind of
make my own. Because the noun and verb (12 and 2) result in out-of-bounds
errors on the sample data, I set those values to 10 and 9. That way, the
behavior is the same.

For part two, I just made up a target value for the sample.
