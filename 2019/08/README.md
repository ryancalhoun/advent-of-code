# Day 8: Space Image Format

[Full info here](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/8)

The data for list is an Image, as a list of Layers, where
each Layer is a simple array of pixels.

Each layer has the ability to count pixels of a particular
value, needed for part one.

For part two, I create a new layer to hold a flattened image.
